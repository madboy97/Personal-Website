	<h1 style="color:grey;">Mechanical Electricity Generator</h1>
	<a style="color:grey;"> Subject: Applied Physics</a><br>
	<a style="color:lightyellow;"> In this project our group created a mechanical electricity generator which can produce electricity if we provide mechanical energy to its motor. </a>
</br>
<b style="color:salmon;"> Working: </b><br>
<a style="color:white;"> We started to move motor's axle by a padel which was extended from motor, As we gave that padel mechanical energy it produced electrical energy due to induction. As moving a magnet through the center of the circle caused current to flow in the wire.The current stopped when he stopped moving the magnet, and it flowed in the opposite direction when he reversed the direction of the magnet.
By hand given mechanical energy we were able to give enough energy that can light a small 3v bulb</a>
<br><b style="color:aqua;"> Future: </b><br>
<a style="color:white;"> This project can be used in large scale in windy area where we can convert mechanical energy to electrical energy and it can also be used in water as through water waves we can produce electricity easily.

	<h1 style="color:grey;">School Website</h1>
	<a style="color:grey;"> Subject: Data-Base</a><br>
	<a style="color:white;"> In this project we made a working school website which can be used for schools for saving their data and compile their data. </a><br>
	<b style="color:salmon;"> Working: </b><br>
	<a style="color:white;"> In website there was a login page where there was a separate login pages for Teachers and Student. When they click login buttom it will redirect them to teir respective pages.
	<b style="color:salmon;"> Teacher/Accountant/Examination Department Page: </b><br>
	<a style="color:white;"> In this page Teacher can enter marks of student, Class teacher can review result of respective class students. Examination department can add and review student result and can edit their result and add theior result and they also can upload and download csv files as it will be easy for them to upload and download result collectively.</a><br>
	<b style="color:salmon;"> Student Page: </b><br>
	<a style="color:white;"> Students can review their attendance history, they can check their result. They also can get notifications for different changes in school regading students. There is an event page where they can suggest, host, and take part in event and know about upcomming school event timings</a>
